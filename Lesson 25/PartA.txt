The result of this code starts by computing the initial transactions before a reset. When the addItem method is 
invoked with arguments of 3.00 and 1.50, the internal total of the CashRegister object is set to 4.50. The first 
System.out.printf statement then prints Total = $4.50, with the formatting string used to display the double value 
to two decimal places. Immediately after this, the clear() method is called, 
which essentially resets the register's internal sum and item count to zero, erasing all the previous information.

After the reset, the code adds two more items, this time with prices of 2.00 and 2.50. Since the previous information 
has been erased, the new item count is set to 2 and the new total to 4.50. The program then prints You have 2 items. 
followed by another formatted line, Total = $4.50. Although the final total is the same as the first one, it is actually 
a brand new set of transactions, since the clear() method ensured that the information did not add up to a cumulative total of 9.00.
