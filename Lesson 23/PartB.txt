The result of the code will be 3, this is due to the way Java treats the finally block 
and the return statements. If we call the getInt() method, the code within the try block 
will be executed, and the return statement "return 1;" will be encountered, at which point 
the JVM "buffers" the return of the value 1. The code within the finally block must be executed 
before the method actually returns, and since a return statement is included within the finally 
block, this statement "overrides" the previously "buffered" return statement. 
In Java, a return statement or an exception in a finally block always has the "last word."
